# Virtual-Stock-Market-Simulater
This web app is intended to provide a simulation of the real stock market. Every user is given an initial amount of 100,000 dollars, which they can use to purchase a variety of stocks. For each stock, we provide a line chart of its price for the last three years so that user can do some analysis.
